# A standard bmc might connect with:
bmc:power "gofishs://ADMIN@127.0.0.1:8800" {
	#username => "ADMIN",
	password => "ADMIN",
	#driver => "gofishs", # https gofish

	state => "on",

	Meta:poll => 10, # required until BMC's support real events!
}

# The testing rpc example can connect to: rpcs://127.0.0.1:8800 instead.
